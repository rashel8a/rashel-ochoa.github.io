              <h2 class="pg-label">Why Starstuff?</h2>
              <p class="text-box">Ideas come in many forms. A shared link, an exchange of words, an eye-catching image on the subway — these are just some mediums that have the ability to ignite a story, breathing life into something that was once just a passing thought. As natural-born creators we always seek to validate our ideas, to know if we’re headed in the right direction. But how?<br> <br>Cloud storage web applications haven’t necessarily positioned themselves as a “place to bring ideas to life,” but this project has led me to believe that this is exactly what people want. I designed Starstuff specifically for this reason, to serve as a new kind of workspace that helps users animate their ideas seamlessly and share them with a robust community. </p>

              <p class="text-box">After getting over the fact that I couldn’t tackle every problem that came my way, I began noticing patterns that dictated my focus on the two problems I simply couldn’t ignore.</p>
              <ol>
                <li><span><br>1) Low interface discoverability.</span> <br>The inability to find new content due to a cluttered user interface increased users’ cognitive overload so much that many felt forced to learn platforms through unnecessary trial and error.</li>
                <li><span><br>2) Untapped community features.</span> <br>Cloud storage solutions fall short, failing to reach their full potential by overlooking untapped features. While I had initially set out re-examine the usability of current cloud storage products, what I found — in addition to a streamlined user experience — was the need for community project sharing and saving features that would optimize the creative and iterative processes.</li>

              <h3 class="pg-topic">The solution</h3>
              <h2 class="pg-label">The seamless experience & a community-oriented environment</h2>
              <p class="text-box">Solving for two completely different problems didn’t come easy as it was a process of continuous reiteration. To solve for the problem of low discoverability, I made the following design decisions:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Design a simple, “invisible” interface focusing on one chief button per page</li>
                <li>Use top-level navigation and organize items into "Categories"</li>
                <li>Integrate an on-boarding tour to educate new users on the primary navigation</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="text-box"><br>But that wasn’t all. Through my research, I realized that users wanted more than a seamless user experience – they were looking for a community-oriented environment to interact with like-minded people. Starstuff fills the gap in this space by introducing the “Links” and “Groups” sections, allowing users to save links, publish work to a group for feedback, and browse inspirational feeds.</p>

              <p class="text-box">To understand how I arrived at the solutions to the problems at hand, I had to go back to the beginning — starting with user research. What did my users want the most from cloud storage? I had a nagging hunch, but to really know the answer I had to turn to research. I began with a <span>user survey</span> and sent them out to my friends, social media, and subreddit in order to understand the goals of my target audience. The results from the survey would inform the following:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>How often users use cloud storage;</li>
                  <li>What are the most important features;</li>
                  <li>What are their top frustrations;</li>
                  <li>What cloud storage platforms were most favored;</li>
                  <li>How often are users using collaboration features;</li>
                  <li>Would users like to save their web links and inspiration to their dashboard;</li>
                  <li>Would they want a solution to assist with brainstorming and collaboration;</li>
                </ul>
              <p class="text-box"><br>The survey questions were completed by over 40 respondents.</p>

                <p class="text-box">To recap the results from the user survey, here were the most prevalent frustrations that continued to resurface when it came to cloud storage platforms:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Creating content amidst an overload of UI elements is frustrating when ideas are fleeting</li>
                    <li>Saving knowledge and inspiration is cumbersome when jumping between multiple platforms</li>
                    <li>Finding and keeping content organized is a hurdle when there are too many files</li>
                    <li>Identifying the right people to bounce ideas off of or provide critique can be challenging</li>

I sought to turn this weakness into Starstuff’s strength by making discoverability a high priority. I also noticed that many users turned to Pinterest for cloud storage because of its easy ability to save ideas and browse inspiration boards. What if Starstuff also offered users the capabilities to save interesting web links to their dashboard and browse inspiration posted by other Starstuff members? Would these features add or subtract from the overall content creation and ideation experience? Again I had a hunch, but I already learned that lesson.</p>

I’ve found that there are limitations to customizing content within docs when you can’t insert multiple file types or notify my team of quickly approaching task due dates.</p>

              <p class="text-box">“Starstuff” was chosen as the brand name because it holds its own propositional density, having both a functional, or literal meaning as well as an emotional one. Starstuff can literally represent the product’s key feature of “starring” or saving stuff within the dashboard. But it also holds a metaphorical interpretation, which is based on Carl Sagan’s theory that humans originate from, or are a product of, the stars. Just as humans are made of the same chemical elements as stars, groundbreaking work is made from a series of evolved ideas and imaginations brought together by many people. Starstuff’s underlying concept is based on the notion that we can’t produce brilliant work unless humans unite to stitch many ideas together.</p>

              <p class="text-box">After selecting the brand name, the logo underwent a plethora of sketch iterations before arriving to its final design. I began the brainstorm with a mindmapping exercise to curate a concept that activated creativity and communicated the formation of a momentous idea.</p>
              <p class="text-box">To maintain consistency with the solar system theme, I focused on using star and rounded planetary shapes. This decision led to the idea of bringing two semi-circles together to produce one bright star, alluding to the process of bringing people together to conjure an idea. In the end, this logo was chosen for its simple, playful and versatile design.</p>

              <p class="text-box">So I’d created the brand idea and logo, but what kind of emotions did I want to convey to my users when maneuvering throughout the product?</p>
              <p class="text-box">Because my users are a younger audience, I chose a combination of bright, contrasting colors and muted slate blue tones to strike a harmonious balance between an engaging, yet relaxing space-themed environment. I chose electric violet as the primary accented color because it evokes a sense of creativity that compliments the muted blues and grays reflecting calmness and dependability. The bright pastel pink and teal colors were used sparingly, sprinkled throughout to supply tiny bursts of energy.</p>

                <h3 class="concl-subhead">Always test your assumptions</h3>
                <p class="text-box">Creating this application challenged me to learn the importance of understanding user objectives. Instead of amplifying existing features and enhancing dashboard navigability within cloud storage, I had to restructure my approach to identify 1) the goals of my target audience, 2) the steps users were undergoing to meet those goals, 3) a solution that would optimize their current process. Throughout this project there were many instances where my anticipations were not the same as my users, forcing me to step back and analyze how I could craft a solution that best fit the needs of the user rather than one stemming from my own assumptions. Thus, the main problem objective of solely enhancing the discoverability of existing cloud storage products had immediately shifted when I found that users also wanted to improve their creative processes by exposing their work to a community of creative people. This realization was the key turning point that I wasn’t expecting.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="key-learnings test">
                <h3 class="concl-subhead">Testing early & often</h3>
                <p class="text-box">If I could give myself one piece of advice before starting, it would be to design less user flows early on in the design process so that I could spend that time focusing on testing just a few primary flows. You can design a solution as meticulously as possible, but there’s nothing quite like experiencing your users frustratingly fail at accomplishing tasks or insightfully delight at a key interaction to reiterate the importance and inevitability of testing.</p>
                <h3 class="concl-sub">Additions beyond the MVP</h3>
                <p class="text-box">If I had more time, I would integrate three key features — notes, chat and advanced search capabilities to allow users to create more types of content quickly, engage even further with their community, and find information through visual and suggested search terms.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="key-learnings">
                <h3 class="concl-heading"><b>Final insights</b></h3>
                <p class="text-box">Designing this solution taught me so much about people, their expectations, and how small changes to even smaller interactions matter. I learned how to empathize and understand the impact that a product can have on a person’s mood when you focus on solving their problems. And in return, it’s amazing how helping my users gleaned a new, humbling perspective on my own goal — designing products that positively impact and serve the greater good. I came to the conclusion that if I can set out to help a person come up with an idea that has the potential to make a tiny fragment of our world a better place, then I have set out to help accomplish something magical and momentous indeed.</p>
