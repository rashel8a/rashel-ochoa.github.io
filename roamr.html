              <p class="text-box">Traveling shouldn’t impede the ability for you to be the fullest expression of yourself. Whether it's finding experiences that suit your personality or meeting the type of people that broaden your perspectives, travel should serve as a gateway to charting your own personal journey.<br><br>With the number of solo travelers skyrocketing, travelers are asking themselves how they can find less frequented places and more diverse cultural experiences. Roamr is a mobile application that changes the way people experience travel by customizing their travel experiences and the people they meet along the way.</p>

              <h2 class="pg-label">Defining the problems</h2>
              <p class="text-box">All traveler types headed to new destinations are frequently faced with the following two questions:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Will they find people along the way that they can travel and connect with?</li>
                <li>Which experiences and activities are worth their fragile time?</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="text-box"><br>While travelers can easily meet people through random occurences, hostels, and group tours, they are often not the best match in terms of their ideal travel buddy. My research shows that travelers want to embark on experiences off-the-beaten path and meet like-minded travelers that directly align with their interests. With more people using dating apps to meet travelers abroad, users have clearly shown that there's a market need for a more targeted and curated travel experience.

                  <li>How passionate were they about traveling;</li>
                  <li>What were their main travel concerns;</li>
                  <li>Did they travel with friends, family or solo;</li>

                  <li>How did they typically find experiences and places to visit;</li>
                  <li>How do they meet other travelers while exploring new places;</li>

Travelers could then follow each other to view their social travel posts, maintain friendships, and get notified if they were in the same city. To see if my assumptions were correct, I sent out a selective user survey to frequent travelers.</p>

                <p class="text-box">To recap, here were the most prevalent frustrations that continued to resurface when it came to exploring new places:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Travelers are used to finding activities that fit their needs rather than having them pushed to them</li>
                    <li>They don’t want to use dating apps or "match" with travelers to find friendships abroad</li>
                    <li>They want curated experiences that they can plan on their own rather than joining "pre-packaged" group tours</li>
                    <li>It was often difficult to meet like-minded travelers because most friendships are made purely by chance</li>
                  </ul>

            <p class="co-text"><span>An app for personalized experiences & plans</span><br>It was clear that my pre-made user assumptions were wrong. Instead of focusing on creating an app that matched like-minded travelers, I decided to deviate from this idea to focus on pushing personalized experiences and plans to users based on their interests and then allowing users to invite travelers to explore these adventures with them together.

                <p class="text-box">While women held the majority of my target audience, I found that solo travelers, couple travelers, and all gender types also found value in this app. This leading theme of designing for inclusivity is what made me switch gears to create a travel app for all types of frequent travelers within the ages of 21 and 34, who loved embarking on new adventures away from the tourist traps.</p>

                <p class="text-box">With user customization being key, I had to ask myself – what was the competition doing to customize experiences to their users?
                <br><br>While Travello does a good job of collecting user's travel interests in the onboarding process, it doesn't continue tailoring its services to the user after the fact. Similarly, Couchsurfing’s “Hangouts” feature doesn’t give users the ability to filter the types of hangouts they’d like to join.
                <br><br>What if users could search for top-rated experiences using new research methods with just a few simple swipes?</b> What if they loved a new adventure sport and wanted to visually search for similar experiences to it in different parts of the world? By incorporating new trip planning and research methods, users could broaden their exposure to new experiences that they otherwise might have missed out on.</p>

But did it take too long for them to complete? Yes. Was the delight of having a conversational chatbot more important than the users time? No. So I redesigned the onboarding process for efficiency, which saved two minutes of the user’s time.</p>

                  <p class="text-box">To suggest the right types of experiences and people to meet, Roamr needs to understand what users enjoy doing while traveling. Instead of selecting from a rigid list of interests, I wanted the app to respond to the user’s choices using machine learning. If users chose “adventure sports” as an interest, they could then find narrower topics like “paragliding” or “sky diving" populate underneath it. Once I’d established a flow that worked, I decided to place them into categories so users could easily scroll to the right section and drill into the “Show more” tab to find tailored interests.</p>

                  <p class="text-box tercer">My hunch that the earth spectacles feature would come across as obscure was indeed, correct. This feature assists with trip planning by enabling users to view an experience location and its top-voted reviews in their current physical form. By selecting an experience, viewing it from different angles, and reading its top-voted reviews, users can identify whether this experience will likely be worth their time. To clear confusion and improve its ease of use, I included nudge-focused tooltips showing users how they can utilize this feature using quick swipe gestures.</p>

Because most users wanted to make a plan to meet with traveler(s) within the next few days, I chose to display “quick day” tags that showed days like “tomorrow” or “Tuesday” rather than specific dates. If the user wanted to make a plan a month ahead of time or within a particular date range, they could do so by selecting the “specific date” or “date range” sections.</p>

However, the user didn't have the ability to change the rating if Roamr had given the user an incorrect rating. To allow this functionality, I made the following three changes.</p>

To fix this, I added a timestamp interaction to show that the plan was added to the user’s “My Plans” page. There, they could click on the “Start chat” button to begin their discussion with the plan owner.</p>

            <h3 class="concl-subhead">Stay focused on the MVP</h3>
            <p class="text-box">Roamr was a passion project I’d been planning on creating ever since I’d returned from my backpacking journey around the world. Even with so many apps at my fingertips, I still felt that it was difficult to find places off the beaten path or meet people who aligned with my travel style. I learned that with passion projects, you need to tread carefully in order to avoid feature creep. While the purpose of Roamr is to be robust and offer features for different user types, being able to draw a line between the "must-haves" and "nice-haves" is critical.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="key-learnings test">
            <h3 class="concl-subhead"><b>User testing as a guiding light</b></h3>
            <p class="text-box">While I had initially thought that Roamr would serve as a platform to match with other travelers and stay connected with them, I’d found that users wanted more than that. They wanted to ease the research portion of their travel process by having experiences suggested to them. While I had a targeted intention for the primary audience, app features, and overall branding at the beginning of this project, I completed it with the project headed in a completely different direction. And that’s more than ok! It means there’s a market need.

            <br><br>In addition to letting user research inform the product tasks and features, I also learned the importance of letting go of the design decisions that I was most attached to — like the 20-screen onboarding chatbot and the filter tab with the slide-left transition process. I learned how to keep myself in check and recognize when my own internal biases and intuitions about what users wanted were taking over. I found that if I’m unsure whether I'm biased or not, testing the specific product flow and/or feature is one of the best ways to find my answer.</p>
