              <p class="text-box">Traveling shouldn’t impede the ability for a person to be the fullest expression of themselves. Whether it's finding experiences that suit your personality or meeting the type of people that broaden your perspectives, travel should serve as a gateway to charting your own personal journey – whatever that may be.<br> <br>With the number of solo travelers skyrocketing over the last couple of years, many eager wanderers are asking themselves how they can find better, less frequented terrains and more diverse cultural experiences. Roamr is a mobile application that changes the way people find and experience travel by customizing the user’s travel experiences and friendly encounters to them completely.</p>

              <h2 class="pg-label">Defining the problems</h2>
              <p class="text-box">Travelers of all types — solo travelers, backpackers, couple travelers, etc. — headed to a new destination are frequently faced with the following two questions:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Will they meet interesting people to adventure and travel with?</li>
                <li>Which experiences and activities are worth their fragile time?</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="text-box"><br>While travelers can easily find people to adventure with through hostels, booking tours, etc. they are often not the best match in terms of the ideal traveler for their personality or travel type. Rather than joining tourist activities created for generic tourists and meeting random people along the way, my research shows that travelers want to embark on their own off the beaten path experiences and meet like-minded travelers that directly relate to their personal interests and travel styles. With a growing number of travelers using dating apps to meet friends abroad, users have clearly shown that there's a market need for a more targeted and curated travel experience.

              <p class="text-box">Today, there is no question that travel must be modernized for a mobile experience and a social world. Roamr addresses this problem by using machine learning to find curated experiences and connect like-minded travelers that suit the user’s personality, motivations, and adventure type with just a few simple swipes. Roamr completely customizes travel experiences to the user and helps them find travelers based off their social travel preferences so they can focus on what’s most important — making travel memories that last a lifetime.

In order to get a good grasp of my target audience, I needed to learn the following:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>How passionate were they about traveling on long or short trips;</li>
                  <li>Had they gone on a solo travel and/or backpacking trip before;</li>
                  <li>What were their main concerns while traveling;</li>
                  <li>Did they typically travel with friends, family or by themselves;</li>
                  <li>What features within a travel app would they find most valuable;</li>
                  <li>What would they like to know about travelers before meeting and adventuring with them;</li>
                  <li>How often do they travel and for how long;</li>
                  <li>How did they typically find experiences and places to visit;</li>
                  <li>How do they meet other travelers while exploring new places;</li>
                  <li>What apps (if any) did they use to meet other travelers;</li>
                </ul>

              <p class="caption">Before analyzing the survey results, I anticipated that this project would focus on the “social” aspect of a travel mobile app. I thought users would be interested in matching with like-minded travelers “Tinder-style” either for a romantic affiliation or friendship. Travelers could then follow each other to view their social travel posts, maintain friendships, and get notified if they were in the same city. The app would target female solo travelers since my initial online research and personal travel experiences showed that women’s primary concerns while traveling were safety. To see if my assumptions were correct, I sent out a selective user survey to frequent travelers. Needless to say, the results surprised me.</p>

They were more interested in inviting people to join their adventurous plans because it provided insights into the user’s personality and generated a natural opportunity for the traveler to reach out to the user if they had common interests.

            <p class="co-text">It was clear that my pre-made user assumptions were wrong. Instead of focusing on creating an app that matched like-minded travelers "Tinder-style", I decided to deviate from this idea to focus on allowing the user to receive personalized adventures based on their interests and then invite nearby travelers to explore these new and diverse experiences together.

                <p class="text-box">While the majority of survey respondents were women between the ages of 21 and 28, the survey results showed that it wasn’t just women who were interested in using a travel app to find new experiences and meet diverse people while wandering to new places. It was single travelers, couple travelers, men, and non-binary genders who all found value in this app. This leading theme of designing inclusive products is what made me switch gears to focus on designing a travel app for all types of people within the ages of 21 and 34, regardless of their travel personality type or preferences.</p>

                <p class="text-box">Travello, Couchsurfing, and TripAdvisor – three major competitors in the travel industry – were the competitors I chose to analyze. With customization to the user being key, I had to ask myself – what were competitors doing to customize their experience to the user?
                <br><br>While Travello does request the user’s travel interests at the beginning of its onboarding process, it doesn’t continue learning about the user’s preferences as the user interacts with the app’s features. Similarly, Couchsurfing’s “Hangouts” feature doesn’t allow its users to filter the types of hangouts they’d like to join. Instead, users must scroll through the list of hangout requests to find an activity they want to join.
                <br><br>I also found that it was difficult to identify the top-rated experiences within both Travello and Trip Advisor, especially when it came to finding experiences off the beaten path. What if users could search for top-voted experiences in a variety of ways using just a couple simple swipes? What if they tried (and loved) a new adventure sport experience and wanted to visually search for similar activities to it in different parts of the world? What if they could see what a place will look like before actually going to it? By incorporating new forms of search and customization features, the user could broaden their scope and target of experiences they’d like to explore. </p>

Would Joaquin and Rory find this addition useful or trivial? Would this addition serve their needs? I knew that asking these questions throughout the design process was key to reaching the MVP.</p>

                  <br><br>Yes, I’d designed an entire 20 screens specifically for this exciting onboarding process. But did it take too long for them to complete? Yes.

No. So I switched it back to the form-filling onboarding process which saved approximately two minutes of the user’s time.</p>

                  <p class="text-box">For the app to suggest the user the right types of experiences and people to meet, it needs to understand what the user loves to do while traveling. Instead of selecting from an established, rigid list of interests, I wanted the app to learn and respond to the user’s selected choices. So if they chose “adventure sports” as a broad activity that they enjoyed, they could then find narrower topics underneath it like “paragliding” or “sky diving." Once I’d established a flow that worked, I decided to place them into categories so the user could easily scroll to the right section and drill into the “Show more” tab to find more specific choices.</p>

Having garnered high attention within the survey results, this feature allows users to see the appearance of an experience and its rating before going to it. The problem was, users were having a tough time understanding how to use it. But after learning about the feature’s utility, users found value in being able to swipe around the screen to view different angles of the experience's location and read the top voted reviews. So to clear confusion on its purpose, I included nudge-focused tooltips showing users how they can utilize this feature to their advantage via swipe gestures.</p>

If the user wanted to make a plan a month ahead of time or within a particular date range, they could do so by selecting the “specific date” or “date range” sections.</p>

For example, if a user chose “snorkeling and scuba diving” and upvoted a posted experience with a beach setting, a beach experience with great snorkeling would be rated quite highly. However, the user didn't have the ability to change the rating if Roamr had given the user an incorrect rating. To allow this functionality, I made the following three changes.</p>

To fix this, I added a timestamp interaction to show that the plan was added to the user’s “My Plans” page. There, they could click on the “Start chat” button to begin their discussion with the plan owner.</p>

            <h3 class="concl-subhead">Stay focused on the MVP</h3>
            <p class="text-box">Roamr was a passion project I’d been planning on creating ever since I’d returned from my backpacking journey around the world. Even with so many apps at my fingertips, I still felt that many apps didn’t meet my demands when attempting to find my kind of experiences, places, and like-minded people while on the road. I was so passionate about this project however, I ended up inputting more features than I believe was truly needed for the MVP. While the purpose of Roamr is to be robust and offer features for different user types, being able to draw a line between the "must-haves" or highest priority features and "nice-haves" or medium priority features is critical. Nevertheless, Roamr’s purpose is intentional and robust in its motive of providing people with the experiences they deserve.
          </div>
          <div class="key-learnings test">
            <h3 class="concl-subhead"><b>Let the users dictate the project's direction</b></h3>
            <p class="text-box">I also learned the importance of letting users help you guide the direction of an application. While I had initially thought that Roamr would serve as a platform to match with other travelers and stay connected with them, I’d found that users wanted more than that. They wanted to ease the research portion of their travel process by having experiences suggested to them. While I had a targeted intention for the primary audience, app features, and overall branding at the beginning of this project, I completed it with the project headed in a completely different direction. And that’s more than ok! It means there’s a market need. Because this was a passion project, all my excitement and energy was invested in each phase of the design process and features. So much so, that I let myself throw out the basic UX design principles by holding onto some design decisions and user stories that I was most passionate about — like the filtering transition process and the nearby friend locator which would notify you if your traveler friends were in the same city as you. I learned that I need to keep myself in check, to identify whether my own biases and opinions about what users want are taking over. I found that if I’m unsure of this question, testing the application is one of the best ways to find my answer.
            </p>
            <h3 class="concl-sub">Additions beyond the MVP</h3>
            <p class="text-box">If I could expand beyond the scope of my MVP (and if I had more time), I’d design the user flows that are displayed within many screens on the prototype but were not clickable. Some of these included the ability to “explore travelers” on the “explore” tab, post to a travel forum rather than just an experience review, upload an image to view similar experiences to it using the visual search, and search for specific experiences in specific locations for those who’d like to plan ahead of their trips.</p>
